# AzureServiceBus.Microservices
 Message busses and queues are a powerful tool for communicating between applications. They are used extensively in microservices, but they can be useful in larger applications as well. In this repo, I'm going to look at how to implement Azure Service Bus queues into our applications to both send and receive messages. The best part is that even though I'll be using Azure, it will only cost 5 cents per month to use these queues, even in production.
